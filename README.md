All random small to medium programming projects and code I've worked on that do not really need a full repo for each

Projects from within here may make their way into their own repositories in the future, somehow, but for now they are just things I've worked on that I'd like to keep in a git repo for backup purposes and review

This repo does not have to have very strict organizational requirements
