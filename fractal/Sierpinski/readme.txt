This is a notso simple Serpinski's triangle generator. I like the colors...

Doesn't everyone like fractals?

Press and hold 'UP' to increase the iteration value
And 'DOWN' to... Well you know

I have to see how to fix the refresh rate problem....

Version 2 fixes the refresh rate problem and adds an info menu
Press and hold 'Triangle' to view some basic data
'L' and 'R' print random dots, not much use, but I thought it would be cool
And 'Circle' Erases the screen, along with iterations... Duh
