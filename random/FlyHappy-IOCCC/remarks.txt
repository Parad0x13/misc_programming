Compleated 29Aug13
My second attempt at Obfuscated C
To be submitted to 22nd IOCCC Competition (01Aug13-03Oct13)
www.ioccc.org

-== Personal Remarks ==-
When I win I would like my source and binary renamed to Parad0x13
That's a zero... it's very important... 0x13 is one of my favorite DOS video modes

-== Levels of Obfuscation ==-

- Simple -

name[index] --> index[name]
Obfuscated variable/struct names

Global variables accessed through global array.
E.G. all global variables concatenated into: int globals[8];

Dramatic abuse of global variables for different purposes

- Not as simple -

Reuse of the same struct type for different types of uses.
For instance the 'walls' and the 'entities' use the same struct

Use of semi-magic numbers (not really magical so kinda magical)

Misleading use of '<' in the source

Intense abuse of ()?():()

Concatenated multiple array run-throughs of unrelated processes in a single loop
E.G.
[Source]
for(int d=0;d<10;d++)renderWall(walls[d]);
for(int d=0;d<20;d++)renderEntities(entities[d]);
[/Source]
Turns into:
[Source]
for(int d=0;d<20;d++) {
	renderEntities(entities[d]);
	if(d<10)renderWalls(walls[d]);
}
[/Source]
