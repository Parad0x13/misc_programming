Need to fix zooming functions for 2D Strange Attractors, make it minx maxx miny maxy mapped

Have a view box for the min max (x, y) for fractals, and allow them to be editable

Iterate ONLY zoomed area in strange attractors

On low iterations for Henon fractal, white dot appears at (0, 0) Fix this (Looks like the same for Tinkerbell)

It appears on all 2d strange attractors white dot is drawn first before other dots

Add timing functions for Cellular Automata

When you are at low iterations for 2d SA and have it rotated through a 3d SA it draws weird random points!

To speed up automata, buffer many lives in advanced and then just print them
^- refer to automata optimization text
Find out whats needed to add zooming box to 2d SA too

For Mandelbrot fractal benchmark, calculate fractal redraws without rendering, and find time after that, with "Calculating Please Wait..."

Create a InitOpenGL for each type of graph, e.g. bifurcation, complex, cardison, cobweb etc...

Have axis button restricted to only 3d fractals, disabled for anything else

Create 2d fractal small axis lines, e.g. small grey lines

Create "Areas of Interest" options to select from from different fractals, probably in scroll down box

Add sliders to change SA values (possibly creating a bifurcation map)

Add julia viewer for mandelbrot fractal
able to save image on screen

Create a "frame" for controls for specific fractals. These forms can be appended to individual frames
