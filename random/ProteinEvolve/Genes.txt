Critters are 1 pixel in size
Can eat food they come across to extend life or produce more babies
Motor functions are movement in cardinal directions
Actions are determined by genes
Genes represented by 4 letters (A, T, C, G)
Genes are seperated by sequence identifiers:
	Start:	ATCG
	Stop:	GCTA

After start identifier the sequence determines the structure of a gene
For instance in the sequence: ATCG AAGCTTA GCTA the important part is AAGCTTA
Protiens are produced chemically from instructions in these genes:
	A: Move Up
	T: Move Down
	C: Move Left
	G: Move Right
So the protine produced by the gene (AAGCTTA) looks like:
XX
X
S
Where S is part of the gene and is the starting position

Attributes of the protine are:
	Height: 3
	Width: 2
	How many are filled in square: AAGCTTA = 4/6

Motor function can be initiated by certain protein shapes

Gene 0: Eating
Gene 1: Up Movement
Gene 2: Down Movement
Gene 3: Left Movement
Gene 4: Right Movement
